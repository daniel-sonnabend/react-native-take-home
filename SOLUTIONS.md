# 1. Run the App

- I searched for the environment setup on the React Native website.
- It said that I need Node, the React Native command line interface, a JDK, and Android Studio.
- I already had Android Studio and a JDK installed.
- I downloaded Node from nodejs.org.
- The recommended JDK was 17, my version was lower. So I updated to 17.
- Then I just worked through the remaining points in the guide.
- After that I created a virtual device in Android Studio and started it.
- I opened a terminal and used "npm start".
- In the Android Studio terminal I used "npm run android".
